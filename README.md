# Alter HN

I created this add on because I'd like to be able to customize certain aspects of [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com).

The add-on is still in development, but right now it makes story and comment links open in a new tab.

## Current features

* Open submissions in new tabs
* Open comment pages in new tabs
* Distinguish submitter in comments
* Add link to your submissions in navigation
* Add [l+c] link to open both the link and the comments with one click

## Screenshots
